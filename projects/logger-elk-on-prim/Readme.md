Index is configurable in Logstash side, then you have to point your log4j to ship the logs to that index. This is the example index weâ€™ve got in Splunk for Trustpower:

         <SplunkHttp name="splunk" url="https://splunkhec.tpower.net.nz" token="${sys:splunk.token}"
             sourcetype="log4j" index="mulesoft" disableCertificateValidation="false">
                 <PatternLayout pattern="%m" />
         </SplunkHttp>


But on your case, you have to use Socket Appender.
