Hi there,

This is a collection of odds and ends of dataweave muckaround examples - sorted into rough areas.

Best way to use is to go to "preview" and "source" mode on the transform message component.

Occasionally it might help to toggle between different output formats to see things like types.

You can then build/add to it yourself by creating a new flow with a transform message to play with something simple. Tip: always leave things in a working state!

Any feedback/additions - drop me a line choudhary.study@gmail.com
